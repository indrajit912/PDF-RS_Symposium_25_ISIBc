\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} Continuous piecewise monotone maps on compact intervals provide simple examples of dynamical systems, however their behavior can be veryÂ complex. In fact, even the simplest of such maps, which is piecewise linear and has only one turning point,   can be chaotic in the sense of both Devaney and Li-Yorke, such as the so-called tent map. In this talk we will look at certain invariants for such maps that can help us in classifying them up to topological conjugacy.

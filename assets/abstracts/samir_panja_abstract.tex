\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} In this talk, we  will consider de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of a considerably large class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and find a characterization for them to be complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces. 
    We will show that a non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak space, associated to a contractive multiplier, of the Hardy space over the bidisc or the Bergman space over the unit disc is a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space if and only if it is isometrically isomorphic to the Hardy space over the unit disc as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. On the contrary, it will be shown that non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of the Hardy space over the $n$-disc with $n\geq 3$ are never complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces.  The talk will be based on joint work with H. Ahmed, B.K. Das.

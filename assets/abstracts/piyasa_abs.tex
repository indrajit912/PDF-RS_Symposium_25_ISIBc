\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a separable Hilbert space. A one-parameter $E_0$-semigroup $\{\alpha_t\}_{t \geq 0}$ is a family of unital, normal, $*$-endomorphisms of $B(\mathcal{H})$ that obey the semigroup property, along with some continuity conditions. $E_0$-semigroups can be classified into three types depending upon the "abundance" of units and whether the said units generate the associated product system. One-parameter $E_0$-semigroups have been studied extensively by Powers, Arveson and other authors, and Arveson showed in his works that a one-parameter $E_0$-semigroup is a CCR flow if and only if it has units and is type I. He also introduced a numerical invariant, called the index, which provides an estimate about the number of units of an $E_0$-semigroup.

In this talk, I shall give a brief introduction to multi-parameter $E_0$-semigroups, focusing on CCR flows over closed convex cones in $\mathbb{R}^d$, briefly touching on the differences between the one-parameter and multi-parameter theory. I shall also define Induced Isometric Representations, where we "induce" isometric representations from discrete semigroups onto continuous ones, and explain how these help with achieving uncountably many examples of \emph{prime} type I CCR flows with index $k$, for any $k \in \mathbb{N} \cup \{\infty\}$.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} The idea of paired operators can be traced back at least to Widom's 1960s work in the context of singular integral equations. In this talk, we will discuss about paired operators on the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ of all Lebesgue square-integrable functions on the unit circle $\mathbb{T}$. Toeplitz and Hankel operators have different facades and flavors, but the classification problem of paired operators on $L^2(\mathbb{T})$ prompted us to investigate Toeplitz + Hankel operators on the Hardy space, and they have also been classified. We will also introduce the notion of inner-paired operators defined on the classical model spaces and discuss about its classification. This talk is based on a joint work with Nilanjan Das and Jaydeb Sarkar.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} In this talk, we shall discuss the classification of bounded operators that are products of two orthogonal projections on a Hilbert space. Our results complement some of the classical results of Crimmins and von Neumann. We also characterize the products of two inner projections defined on the Hardy space over the unit polydisc. This talk is based on a joint work with Jaydeb Sarkar.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} Given a finite twisted ideal polygon in \(\mathbb{H}^3\), there exists a harmonic
map heat flow \(u_t : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H}^3\) such that the image of \(u_t\) is asymptotic to that
polygon for all \(t \in [0, \infty)\). We extract a sequence \(\hat{u_n}\) such that the image
of leaves corresponding to certain quadratic differential under \(\hat{u_n}\) has bounded
geodesic curvature and the bound is independent of \(n\). Moreover, if the bound
is less than 1, then there exists a sequence \(\hat{u_n}\) which subconverges to a harmonic
map \(\hat{u}_\infty : \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{H}^3\)  asymptotic to a twisted ideal polygon.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} In 2000, VanderKam proved that for sufficiently large primes $p$, the Hecke operators are linearly independent in their actions on the cycle $\bold{e}$ from $0$ to $\infty$ in the space of weight $2$ cuspidal modular symbols for $\Gamma_0(p)$. I will talk about the generalization of VanderKam's result to modular symbols of higher weights. This is a joint work with D. Banerjee.

\noindent\textbf{Abstract.}  A lemniscate of a monic complex polynomial \( Q_n \) is the sublevel set \( \{z \in \mathbb{C} \mid |Q_n(z)| < t\} \) for some \( t > 0 \). Erd≈ës, Herzog, and Piranian initiated the study of lemniscates, focusing on geometric and topological properties such as area, length, and the number of connected components of unit lemniscates (\( t = 1 \)) in their 1958 paper \cite{metricEHP}. While the maximal length of a lemniscate for a degree-\( n \) polynomial is known to be of the order \( n \), this talk explores the \emph{typical length} of random polynomial lemniscates. Using an integral geometric formula, we show that for polynomials with i.i.d. roots uniformly distributed in \( \mathbb{D} \), the expected length of their lemniscates is bounded above by \( O(\log n) \), significantly less than the optimal order.

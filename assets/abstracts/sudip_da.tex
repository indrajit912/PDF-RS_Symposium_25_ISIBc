\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} In this talk, we shall describe all the invariant subspaces of a completely nonunitary contraction $T_c$ with nonzero scalar constant characteristic function $c$, where $|c|<1$. Moreover, we show that $T_c$ and the restriction to its invariant subspaces are essentially normal. Using this description of $T_c$- invariant subspaces, we then identify the hyperinvariant subspaces.

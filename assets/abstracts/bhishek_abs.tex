\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} I will introduce the Lefschetz algebra $L^*(X)$ on a smooth complex projective variety $X$ and construct an example which does not satisfy the analogues of Hard Lefschetz and Poincar\`e Duality. To do this I will introduce Grassmanians and flag varieties.
The contents of this talk are mostly from the paper by June Huh and Botong Wang - Lefschetz Classes on Projective Varieties.

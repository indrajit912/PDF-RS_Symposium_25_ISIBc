\noindent\textbf{Abstract.} The problem of completing partially specified matrices to positive matrices
has been extensively studied due to its theoretical significance and practical applications.
In this talk, we address an analogous problem: completing a linear map on \(C^*\)-algebras
to a completely positive map. It is shown that whenever such a completion is feasible
there exists a unique minimal completion. This theorem is used to show that under
some very general conditions a completely positive map almost everywhere equivalent
to a quasi-pure map is actually equal to that map. This talk is based on a joint work
with my advisor Prof. B. V. R Bhat.
